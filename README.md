## Logger usage

This project includes a small `Logger` helper at `src/shared/Logger.luau` with configurable log levels.

- Default behavior: only `WARN` and `ERROR` messages are printed.
- To change the log level at runtime (development only), call:

```lua
local Logger = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Shared"):WaitForChild("Logger"))
Logger.setLevel("DEBUG") -- or "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR"
```

Use `DEBUG` while working locally to see additional diagnostic output, and switch back to `WARN` before committing.
